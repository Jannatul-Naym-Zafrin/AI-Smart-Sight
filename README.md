# AI-Smart-Sight
# SmartSight  + AI Scene Narrator  

A combined hardware + AI software solution designed for **blind and visually impaired individuals**.  
This project integrates:  

1. **SmartSight (Smart Stick)** – an ESP32-powered obstacle detection stick with GPS and buzzer alerts.  
2. **AI Scene Narrator** – an AI-driven system that uses a camera and Google’s Gemini AI to describe scenes in natural language and narrate them via speech.

##  Features

### SmartSight (Hardware Stick)
- Obstacle Detection:** Ultrasonic + IR sensors detect objects in the path.  
- Audio Feedback:** Alerts via buzzer (extendable to voice/vibration).  
- GPS Tracking:** Provides live location data for safety/navigation.  
- ESP32 Powered:** Wi-Fi + Bluetooth for future mobile integration.  
- Low Cost & Portable:** Affordable, easy-to-carry design.  

###  AI Scene Narrator (Software App)
- Live Camera Feed** using OpenCV  
- Capture Images** via button or voice command ("capture")  
- Scene Description** with Google Gemini AI  
- Text-to-Speech (TTS)** narration of AI responses  
- Multilingual Support:** English, Bangla, Spanish, French, German, Hindi  
- Voice Command Mode** for hands-free use  
- Auto-save** images + AI responses
